# Mr-Potatohead

This app uses checkboxes to create a Potatohead! 

When a checkbox is checked the corresponding bodypart appears, and when the checkbox is unchecked, the bodypart disappears.

The app is also able to change orientation, portrait to landscape and back, while retaining the checked boxes and visible bodyparts.
